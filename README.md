# Pheatures Online

This project is an online version of [Pheatures Spreadsheet](https://linguistics.ucla.edu/people/hayes/120a/Pheatures/),
a program used to analyze phonetic features.

Pheatures Spreadsheet was originally programmed by Floris van Vugt with advice from
Professor Bruce Hayes and Professor Kie Zuraw at the UCLA Department of Linguistics.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
