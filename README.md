# Pheatures Online

This project is an online version of [Pheatures Spreadsheet](https://linguistics.ucla.edu/people/hayes/120a/Pheatures/),
a program used to analyze phonetic features.

Pheatures Spreadsheet was originally programmed by [Floris van Vugt](https://www.florisvanvugt.com)
with advice from Professor [Bruce Hayes](https://linguistics.ucla.edu/people/hayes/)
and Professor [Kie Zuraw](https://linguistics.ucla.edu/people/zuraw/)
at the UCLA Department of Linguistics.
